= Using the ownCloud iOS App
:toc: right
:experimental:

== Introduction

Accessing your files on your ownCloud server via the Web interface is easy and convenient, as you can use any Web browser on any operating system without installing special client software. 
However, the ownCloud iOS app offers some advantages over the Web interface:

* A simplified interface that fits nicely on an iPhone or iPad
* Automatic synchronization of your files
* Share files with other ownCloud users
* Easily upload files from your device to ownCloud
* Optional PIN for stronger security

Log in and look on your Personal page for a link to the ownCloud app on iTunes. 
When you install the ownCloud app and open it you’ll be prompted for your ownCloud server URL and login. 
When it connects it opens to your Files page.

All your files on your ownCloud server are listed on the Files page, but are not downloaded to your iPhone or iPad until you tap on them. 
Downloaded files are marked with a little green arrow. 
Thumbnails are displayed for both downloaded and not-downloaded files (owncloud 8.0+ only). 
Click the overflow button at the top right (the three-dot button) to upload files to your server, create a new folder, or sort your files alphabetically or by date.

The Files button at the bottom takes you back to your main Files page.
The Uploads button shows your history of uploads to your ownCloud server. 
The Shared Links button shows how many files you have shared by link.

When you’re in the Files view, slide any filename to the right to expose your file management options.

[[deleting-files]]
== Deleting Files

The trash can allows you to delete the file from your device, your ownCloud server, or both.

[[instant-upload-of-photos-and-videos]]
== Instant Upload of Photos and Videos

image:ios-instant-uploads-all-disabled.png[Instant Uploads]

New in version 3.5.2 is the ability for instantly uploading to ownCloud any photos and videos which you create with your iPhone. 
In Settings, you’ll find a new section titled *Instant Uploads*. 
In that section you’ll see, initially disabled, two options. 

These are:

* Instant Upload Photos
* Instant Upload Videos

Toggle the one that you want, or both, if that’s your preference.

When enabling ``__Instant Upload Photos__`, you will be prompted to allow access to your photos, as you can see in the screenshot below. 
For this functionality to work, you have to click ``OK`.

image:ios-instant-uploads-enabled-access-notification.png[ownCloud needs access to your photos for Instant Upload Photos to work.]

When enabling ``__Instant Upload Videos__`, you will need to have Location Services enabled. 
Otherwise, you’ll see the notification in the screenshot below. 
For this functionality to work, Location Services are required.

image:ios-instant-uploads-videos-location-services-notification.png[ownCloud needs Location Services to be enabled for Instant Upload Videos to work.]

Once you have enabled one or both of the Instant Upload options, a new folder, called InstantUpload, will appear in your Files view. 
If you click on it, you will see all of the photos and videos which have been automatically uploaded from your iPhone to your ownCloud account, as in the image below.

image:ios-instant-upload-file-list.png[Photos and videos which were automatically uploaded to ownCloud by Instant Upload.]

== Clear the Cache

image:ios-clear-cache.png[Clear the ownCloud account cache on iOS.]

If you need to delete all the local files within the current account, or a specific account if you have more than one enabled, then click the "_More Options icon_"^1^ next to the relevant account.
Next, click the second menu item, btn:[Clear cache] ^2^, and the local files within that account will be cleared.

IMPORTANT: Available Offline files *won't* be deleted.

[[sharing-files-1]]
== Sharing Files

You can share with other ownCloud users, and create public share links. 
If your ownCloud server administrator has enabled username auto-completion, when you start typing user or group names they will auto-complete. 
After you have shared files, click the Share button to see who you have shared with, and to remove shares.

You may also create Federation shares from your iOS app. 
If you are sharing files with ownCloud 9.x users, you can enter their username (auto-completion is supported for Federation sharing) and server URL in the User and Groups dialog to create a Federation share; for example freda@example.com/owncloud. 

The exact Federation share link is on every ownCloud user’s Personal page in the ownCloud Web interface.
Please note that this is not yet fully-implemented in the iOS app: your recipient needs to use their ownCloud Web interface to receive the notification asking if they wish to accept the share, and then they must click an ``Accept` button.

image:ios-sharing.png[File sharing dialog.]

You may share files with people who are not using ownCloud, and with older ownCloud servers by creating a share link. 
Tap ``Get Share Link`, and this opens a menu with options to automatically create an email notification, or to copy the link so that you can paste it wherever you like. 
You have options to put an expiration date on the share, and to password-protect it.

When you create a share link on a folder, you also have the option to make it editable.
